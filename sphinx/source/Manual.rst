.. seealso:: There is also the Option included to hide knots with two edges or to scale knots and edges.

Pro-Vertex-Radius (PVR)
-----------------------
Use the PVR option to manually scale knots or/and edges. Just set a bevel-weight for each vertex of the source wireframe. The bevel-weights will act as a scaling factor.

Setting bevel-weight:

The knots and/or edges will be scaled:

   :scale: 50 %
   :align: center


.. note::

    Bevel-weights are set to 0.0 if you dont change them. A bevel-weight of 0.0 will fully hide the knot.

Hide knots with two edges
-------------------------

To hide knots with only two edges choose this option. In the following picture you can see the effect.
