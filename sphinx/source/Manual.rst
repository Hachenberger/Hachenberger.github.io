Knot Pro-Vertex-Radius (PVR)
------------------------------
Use the PVR option to manually scale knots. Just set a bevel-weight for each vertex of the source wireframe. The bevel-weights will act as a scaling factor.

Setting bevel-weight:

The knots will be scaled:

.. note::

    Bevel-weights are set to 0.0 if you dont change them. A bevel-weight of 0.0 will fully hide the knot.
